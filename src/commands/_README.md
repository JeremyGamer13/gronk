# Command Expectation
A new command should meet these requirements:
- Either useful, inside-server joke/fun or requested
- Image commands should be fun & work as expected for users
- Nothing huge will happen without the user knowing
- Commands that involve other users (ex: ship) respect the interactions command
- Commands that output user-input text in a readable way are moderated
- Admin/Exclusive commands have proper permissions set

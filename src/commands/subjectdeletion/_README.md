# subjectdeletion
These are commands likely to be deleted from the bot and need some sort of validation to stay.
If none is found, delete them.

Reasons for deletion:
- Fundamentally exploitable (the idea of the command is already unsafe or bad)
- Can't reasonably work well as a bot command
- Don't fit the project
- Broken, or relies on something that is broken now
- No one uses it and it's not really fun, useful or interesting

## Why delete commands at all?
Reduces bloat, basically we need less stuff that no one cares about &
ideally the bot shouldn't just be a mash up of 30 other discord bots,
just what is actually important from them
